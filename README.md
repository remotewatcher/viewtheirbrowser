> Please update your browser watcher ASAP. The remote add-on is OK.


**Remote Watcher** is a powerful utility that lets you **view and interact with remote browser tabs** as if they were in your own browser. Designed for support professionals, developers, and privacy-conscious users, it enables real-time tab mirroring and interaction using two lightweight browser add-ons.

🔗 **Access the project:** [remotewatcher.onion](http://remotewatcher.onion) (find me in TOR

### 🌐 How to Access the Site (Tor Network)

To access the **Remote Watcher** site, you'll need to use the [Tor Browser](https://www.torproject.org/). Once installed, search dark web directories or forums for keywords like:

- `"Remote Watcher"`
- `"browser tab sharing tool (onion)"`

The project is hosted as a Tor hidden service for privacy and anonymity. **The full `.onion` address is not published openly** — this is intentional, to protect both users and the project itself. Be sure to use trusted sources and always verify links before visiting.

## ⚙️ How It Works

Remote Watcher uses a **WebSocket-based proxy server** to connect two browser extensions:

- **Remote Add-on** – Installed on the user's browser whose tabs will be shared.
- **Watcher Add-on** – Installed on your browser to select and interact with shared tabs.

This system creates a secure, real-time link between the two browsers.

## 🛡️ Privacy & Security

- ✅ Only tabs explicitly shared by the Remote add-on are visible.
- ✅ End-to-end communication via WebSockets.
- ✅ No screen sharing or full desktop access — only browser tab content.

For maximum privacy, the tool is accessible through the Tor network at:
